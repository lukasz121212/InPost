Hello InPosts Reviewers 😊 <br/>

I believe I have completed all the tasks, except for those related to Docker. <br />

To be honest, I had never used Docker in my projects before. It’s something new for me, and I’ve only been learning it for the past few days. Right now, I know just the basics and am progressing step by step. <br />

I did my best to prepare the Docker image and Docker Compose files, but unfortunately, I wasn't able to complete them. I think this might be more complex due to my project being divided into API and GUI modules. At this moment, I’m not sure if this was the best approach — perhaps keeping everything in a single module would have been simpler and would have allowed me to complete the Docker-related tasks.<br/> 
I hope I’ll have the opportunity to discuss this with you in the next stage of the recruitment process. <br />

For now, I’ve decided not to extend the deadline for finishing this assignment. I committed to completing it by the next day, and I want to keep my word — so I’m submitting my solution as it is. <br/> 

That being said, I will definitely do my best to complete the Docker-related tasks for my own learning in the coming days. <br />

Thank you! <br/>
